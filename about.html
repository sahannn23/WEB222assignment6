    <p>Hello! I’m a web development student who is taking WEB222 course in Seneca College with a deep passion for travel, culture, and exploring the world’s hidden gems. For this project, I chose to focus on Sri Lanka—not only because it’s my mother country, but also because it’s a land of incredible diversity, rich heritage, and breathtaking natural beauty. From ancient cities and sacred temples to lush rainforests and pristine beaches, Sri Lanka offers something for every traveler.</p>
    <p>This project is a reflection of both my cultural roots and my love for tourism. It highlights some of the must-visit destinations across the island, aiming to inspire others to explore the vibrant history, warm hospitality, and stunning landscapes that make Sri Lanka truly unique.</p>
